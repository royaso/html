in order to install a terminal based weibo client

choose twei client, it is a nodejs application, so need to install nodejs, but
after yum installing the nodejs,I find that the version of nodejs is too low,
so low that it failed in installing npm. npm is a nodejs package manager. It is
like yum to centos as npm to nodejs.

so install nodejs from source code. download from nodejs.org, 11M ,but really
slow download speed. using python -m SimpleHTTPServer .

./configure && make all && sudo make intall && make clean && make distclean

installing npm from git

git clone git@github.com:isaacs/npm.git
cd npm
sudo node cli.js install npm -gf

it may take a while and it should be sudo

after all that is done,

npm install twei -g //g for global

-----------------------update python on centos----------------
centos is clean, that means if you need to install something you need to get
all the required tools yourself. Because what centos is aimed for is a stable
envirenment. 

yum grouplist
yum grouplist development //or yum groupinstall "development tools"

warning: Because yum uses python2.3(lower version), it is better not to be
messing with the administrator tool(ie:yum), so we won't remove the older
version of python, and It is fine to have two versions of python, more on that
later



download from python office website, according to its website, there are now
two different versions available. 2.7 or 3.3

maybe the newer the better, but i just settle now for 2.7

the usual procedure: ./configure && make all &&  sudo make install && make
clean && make distclean

now when you type python and two press 'Tab',you will see these two different
versions of python, and the trick is the default options is still the older
one. since I rearlly use pyhon,(maybe someday),right now I just using it to
install nodejs. but incase you want it ,follow the next code


mv /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/python2.4
ln -s /usr/local/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python

vim /usr/bin/yum   -----> change the first line where it has python to
python2.7

ok
